# Chessmark
Open Source Design of an android app for opening and reading Chess .pgn files.

General path of development:
Create "Minimum Viable Product" which includes a function to read and store the basic information and moves of a chess game (Players, ratings, date, outcome, etc.) and a simple function for visibly showing the information.
-Design the object and class structure for the project.
-Write pseudocode for the project (Perhaps an alternative pseudocode to take advantage of Kotlin's features)
-Write the real coding
-test

Refine existing programming and add additional features to the project using the above sequence (Example of additional features might be the ability to read and display annotations)

Refine user interface.

Add "chess engine" functionality.
